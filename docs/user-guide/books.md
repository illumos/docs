## [illumos Developer's Guide](https://illumos.org/books/dev/)

This guide covers the basic workflow for developing illumos and then dives into
specific detail on everything from the layout of the gate to several HOWTOs.
Whether this is your first time working with illumos or you remember back when
the code in the gate all referred to something called SunOS, this guide will
help you in enhancing and fixing illumos.

## [Dynamic Tracing Guide](https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/)

DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for the illumos Operating
System. DTrace provides a powerful infrastructure to permit administrators,
developers, and service personnel to concisely answer arbitrary questions about
the behavior of the operating system and user programs. The illumos Dynamic
Tracing Guide describes how to use DTrace to observe, debug, and tune system
behavior. This book also includes a complete reference for bundled DTrace
observability tools and the D programming language.

## [Modular Debugger Guide](https://illumos.org/books/mdb/)

The Modular Debugger (MDB) is a highly extensible, general purpose debugging
tool for the illumos Operating System. The Modular Debugger Guide describes
how to use MDB to debug complex software systems, with a particular emphasis on
the facilities available for debugging the illumos kernel and associated device
drivers and modules. It also includes a complete reference for and discussion
of the MDB language syntax, debugger features, and MDB Module Programming API.

## [Writing Device Drivers](https://illumos.org/books/wdd/)

Writing Device Drivers provides information on developing drivers for
character-oriented devices, block-oriented devices, network devices, SCSI
target and HBA devices, and USB devices for the illumos Operating System
(illumos). This book discusses how to develop multithreaded reentrant device
drivers for all architectures that conform to the illumos DDI/DKI (Device
Driver Interface, Driver-Kernel Interface). A common driver programming
approach is described that enables drivers to be written without concern for
platform-specific issues such as endianness and data ordering.

Additional topics include hardening illumos drivers; power management; driver
autoconfiguration; programmed I/O; Direct Memory Access (DMA); device context
management; compilation, installation, and testing drivers; debugging drivers;
and porting illumos drivers to a 64-bit environment.

## [Memory and Thread Placement Optimization Developer's Guide](https://illumos.org/books/lgrps/)

The Memory and Thread Placement Optimization Developer's Guide provides
information on locality groups and the technologies that are available to
optimize the use of computing resources in the illumos operating system.
