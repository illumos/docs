# Leadership

There are two levels of leadership in the illumos project: Members of the
Developer Council, and Request To Integrate (RTI) Advocates.

## Developer Council

The Dev Council is a technical steering committee drawn from well-known
developers of Solaris, whose role is to make high-level architecture decisions.

| Member          | Organization    |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Adam Leventhal  | Transposit      |
| Bryan Cantrill  | Joyent          |
| Garrett D'Amore | RackTop Systems |
| Gordon Ross     | Nexenta         |
| Rich Lowe       | unaffiliated    |

## Advocates

Advocates are the gatekeepers to the illumos core: they have the ultimate say
in what code is accepted, and their primary job is to ensure quality and
stability for all illumos users.

Advocates are appointed by the illumos Developer Council.

| Member            | Handle     | Organization    | Expertise |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Albert Lee        | trisk      | SoftNAS         | Storage, drivers, userland. |
| Chris Siden       | csiden     | Delphix         | ZFS |
| Dan McDonald      | danmcd     | Joyent          | Cryptography, Networking |
| Garrett D'Amore   | gdamore    | RackTop Systems | Drivers, etc. |
| Gordon Ross       | gwr        | Nexenta         | CIFS/SMB, VFS layer, ZFS ACLs, etc. |
| Hans Rosenfeld    | Woodstock  | Joyent          | Misc. |
| Joshua M. Clulow  | LeftWing   | Joyent          | Misc. |
| Matt Ahrens       | mahrens    | Delphix         | ZFS |
| Rich Lowe         | richlowe   | unaffiliated    | Misc. |
| Robert Mustacchi  | rmustacc   | Joyent          | Virtualization, SMF, PCI, MDB, DTrace, x86 platform, etc. |

## Life as an Advocate

Contributors send you patches, build results, test results, check results,
review results. If you're happy with all of this, you integrate the change on
their behalf.

You should have received a patch in `git format-patch` or similar format,
including a full set of metadata (`Reviewed by:` lines, authorship, etc.). If
you didn't, feel free to ask whoever submitted the patch to submit it in this
format.  You shouldn't have to go search the list archives for reviewers.

While the advocate role is fundamentally one of gate-keeping, it is expected
that advocates are willing and able to help drive towards a positive result.
Use your experience where you can to actively help contributors get to
integration, rather than simply denying changes that aren't well-formed.

### Things Advocates Focus On

* **Do you know the areas of the system affected well enough to even have an
  opinion?**  If not, determine whether another advocate is better placed to
  make a decision.  The codebase is large and our finite resources mean
  that we'll never have complete coverage; sometimes an absence of an obvious
  expert is a learning opportunity!

* **Is the commit well-formed?**  The `Author` field should include both a
  name and a well-formed e-mail address for the change contributor.  Ensure
  that any non-Latin characters in names are correctly rendered in UTF-8.
  The same should be true of any `Reviewed by:` or `Portions contributed by:`
  lines in the commit message.

* **Is the `git pbchk` output as clean as you want it to be?**  In general
  there there should be no noise from any check, however some areas are not
  clean for the various style checks.  It will generally be quite obvious
  upon inspection when a file is not already free of issues.

* **Is the user's build clean?**
    * The contributor should be using the current primary and shadow
      compilers (i.e., GCC 7.3 and GCC 4.4.4).
      Check the `mail_msg` file for the compilers used during the build.
    * The build should be free of compiler warnings and other post-build
      checks, including smatch.

* **Did the submitter test their changes to your satisfaction?**
    * Can you think of anything else that should be tested? Ask for it!
    * Did the testing actually cover the area changed by the patch? Check!

* **Inspect the diff!** Check that nothing stands out that reviewers may have
  missed.

* If there are any open questions about possibly breaking the build, the
  advocate can always elect to run their own build once they have imported the
  patch.

### Integrating Changes

The following is a basic checklist for those pushing to the gate, whether they
are an advocate, or someone granted the right to push their own approved
changes.

* When importing a patch, record the approving advocate with an
  `Approved by:` line in the commit message after the existing
  `Reviewed by:` and `Portions contributed by:` lines.

* Make sure when you import the patch that the `Author:` field reflects
  the submitter of the change and not you, the committer.

* You can (and should) visually inspect outgoing commits prior to pushing
  (to ensure you have done all of the above) with something like:
  ```

* If a push to the gate fails, you **MUST NOT** force push (i.e., `git push
  -f`).  There will _always_ be a reason for the error, which you must fix
  before proceeding.
